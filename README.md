Please obtain a .jpg format picture of your cats and add them to the project directory.

#### Follow these naming conventions:

+ Make sure you name your cat using all lowercase letters and use _ (underscores) instead of spaces.
+ Add the name of your cats to the `catList` array in `app.js`
+ Ensure your cat images and cats in the `catList` array have the same name.
+ Avoid a long naming ceremony of your cats.
